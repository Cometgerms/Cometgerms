**About Me:**

- In theory, I have eight years of programming experience, having become one of the last students to fall into the **Pascal** rabbit hole in third grade. (But seriously, who would've thought Pascal was still a thing in school? Talk about a throwback!)
- In fifth grade, I first encountered Python.
- In sixth grade, I was introduced to HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and began exploring deeper algorithms.
- Seventh grade marked my initial foray into dimensionality reduction algorithms in data science, sparking a deep interest in artificial intelligence. That same year, I started participating in FTC competitions, coding in Java.
- In ninth grade, I applied computer vision to **FTC** robotics(my team was **19604**), utilizing models in a practical context.
- By tenth grade, I advanced to the **USACO Platinum** level and competed in numerous mathematical modeling contests, gaining extensive experience in Python data analysis and model application.
