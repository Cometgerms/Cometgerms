## **About Me:**

- Possessing eight years of programming experience, I began my journey in the world of coding with Pascal in the third grade, making me one of the final waves of students to engage with this classic language. (But seriously, who would've thought Pascal was still a thing in school? Talk about a throwback!)
- My exploration into programming languages expanded in the fifth grade with Python, introducing me to more advanced concepts and broadening my coding repertoire.
- The sixth grade marked my introduction to web development, where I delved into HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. At the same time, I began to explore more complex algorithms, enhancing my problem-solving skills.
- Seventh grade marked my initial foray into dimensionality reduction algorithms in data science, sparking a deep interest in artificial intelligence. That same year, I started participating in First Tech Challenge(FTC) competitions, coding in Java.
- Eighth grade can be considered a milestone for paper writing. I published the research paper ["Research on image dimensionality reduction images"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3502814.3502819)
- In my ninth-grade year, I applied my knowledge of computer vision to FTC robotics, representing my team (number 19604). This practical application of theoretical models was a crucial step in my technological journey. Besides, as the leader of the team, I strengthened my communication and management skills.
- By the tenth grade, I had achieved the USACO Platinum level, showcasing my advanced proficiency in competitive programming. My participation in numerous mathematical modeling contests further refined my skills in Python for data analysis and model application, representing a significant accumulation of practical and theoretical mathematical and computer science knowledge in the field.
